Windows application for Nanoleaf lights

## TODO
- Add option to schedule to turn off lights at application/Windows shutdown (needs state endpoint)
- Add basic logging
- Figure out why Vibrant sunrise does not work
- Adding and deleting triggers now is permanent without saving while it should only be permanent on saving

## Future features (in no particular order):
- Override schedule at any time you want
- Support multiple devices
- Spotify link
- Steam link
- Add custom effect to make the lights the color of your windows screen
- Add migration method for settings file
